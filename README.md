# Features
* GPU-based hairstrand physics using Verlet integration
* Collision against predefined sphere colliders
* Hair strand root placements use a separate mesh for potential spawn points
* Each "strand" is represented by a ribbon of quads oriented to the view using a cylinder constraint
* Interactive in a web browser

# Controls
* Hold left mouse button and move the mouse to rotate the camera
* Use the scroll wheel to zoom
* Different parameters can be controlled in realtime from the UI

# Potential improvements
As the project is very barebones and simple, there are a lot of improvements that could be made. Some examples are:
* Realtime shading using the Marschner model
* Hair-to-hair interactions
* Mipmaps
* More elaborate user controls
* Predefined hair styles
